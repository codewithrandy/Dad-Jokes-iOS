#  Dad Jokes iOS
This will be the iOS version of the Dad Jokes mobile app. The app will display data from Dad Jokes API that I have also added to GitHub. The repo for that project can be found at <a href="https://github.com/codewithrandy/Dad-Jokes-API">Dad Jokes API</a> and was developed using Python and Django.
